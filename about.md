<h1>About This Blog</h1>

The focus of this blog will be the constellation of various JavaScript technologies and OSX workflow, with a particular focus at the moment with Node and Angular 2. I use Sublime Text 3 as my editor.

<h1>About Me</h1>

My name is Rachel and I program for fun. While I don't really like writing descriptive paragraphs about myself, I do enjoy making lists. Some things about me, in list form:

1. My husband is my absolute best friend and favorite person in the world. 
2. This blog is named after my German Shepherd, who I sometimes call my "Puppy of the Universe" - "Universe Pup" for short. Neither of those things are his name.
3. I love running, but I'm ridiculously slow. 45â„‰ and sunny are my favorite conditions.
4. I have an abusive relationship with the game Dota 2. 
5. I take my coffee black or with a small splash of cream.
6. I love the tactile experience of applying makeup, but hate the feel of it actually on my face.
7. Bureaucracy makes my brain stop.
8. I like to rewatch Babylon 5 and Star Trek: Deep Space 9 about once every year and a half. I think the JJ Abrams Trek movie is an abomination. (Are there more than one? I hope not.)
9. I loathe having to do any sort of CSS and am terrible at it.
